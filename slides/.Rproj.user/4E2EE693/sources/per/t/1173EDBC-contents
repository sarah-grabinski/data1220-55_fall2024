## Instructions for the Quick Survey

Please read these instructions **before** writing.

1. Introduce yourself to someone that you don't know.
2. Record the survey answers **for that other person**, while they record your responses.
3. Be sure to complete all 15 questions (both sides.)
4. When you are finished, thank your partner and raise your hand. Someone will come to collect your survey.

Regarding Question 4, Professor Love is the large fellow standing in the front of the room.

## Today's Agenda

- Data Structures and Variables
  - Evaluating some of the Quick Survey variables
- Looking at some of the data collected in Class 01
  - Group Guessing of Ages from 10 Photographs
  - Guessing Dr. Love's Age

## Chatfield's Six Rules for Data Analysis

1. Do not attempt to analyze the data until you understand what is being measured and why.
2. Find out how the data were collected.
3. Look at the structure of the data.
4. Carefully examine the data in an exploratory way, before attempting a more sophisticated analysis.
5. Use your common sense at all times.
6. Report the results in a clear, self-explanatory way.

## Our Quick Survey

![](c02/images/survey_form.png)

## Types of Data

The key distinction we'll make is between

- **quantitative** (numerical) and
- **categorical** (qualitative) information.

Information that is quantitative describes a **quantity**. 

- All quantitative variables have units of measurement.
- Quantitative variables are recorded in numbers, and we use them as numbers (for instance, taking a mean of the variable makes some sense.)

## Continuous vs. Discrete Quantities

**Continuous** variables (can take any value in a range) vs. **Discrete** variables (limited set of potential values)

- Is Height a continuous or a discrete variable?

:::{.incremental}
  - Height is certainly continuous as a concept, but how precise is our ruler?
  - Piano vs. Violin
:::

## Quantitative Variable Subtypes

We can also distinguish **interval** (equal distance between values, but zero point is arbitrary) from **ratio** variables (meaningful zero point.)

:::{.incremental}
  - Is Weight an interval or ratio variable? 
  - How about IQ?
:::

## Qualitative (Categorical) Data

Qualitative variables consist of names of categories.

- Each possible value is a code for a category (could use numerical or non-numerical codes.)
  - **Binary** categorical variables (two categories, often labeled 1 or 0)
  - **Multi-categorical** variables (three or more categories)
- Can distinguish *nominal* (no underlying order) vs. *ordinal* (categories are ordered.)

## Some Categorical Variables

- How is your overall health? <br /> (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Which candidate would you vote for if the election were held today?
- Did this patient receive this procedure?
- If you needed to analyze a small data set right away, which of the following software tools would you be comfortable using to accomplish that task?

## Are these quantitative or categorical?

1. Do you **smoke**? (1 = Non-, 2 = Former, 3 = Smoker)
2. How much did you pay for your most recent **haircut**? (in $)
3. What is your favorite **color**?
4. How many hours did you **sleep** last night?
5. Statistical thinking in your future **career**? (1 = Not at all important to 7 = Extremely important)

- If quantitative, are they *discrete* or *continuous*? Do they have a meaningful *zero point*?
- If categorical, how many categories? *Nominal* or *ordinal*?

## Ingesting the Quick Surveys

![](c02/images/2019_setup.png)

## The Quick Survey

315 people took (essentially) the same survey in the same way.

Fall | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | Total
----: | ----: |----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | -----: | -----:
*n* | 61 | 51 | 48 | 64 | 49 | 42 | **315**

### Question

About how many of those 315 surveys caused *no problems* in recording responses?

## The 15 Survey Items

\#  | Topic         | \#  | Topic
--: | -----------   | --: | -----------
Q1 | `glasses`      | Q9  | `lectures_vs_activities`
Q2 | `english`      | Q10 | `projects_alone`
Q3 | `stats_so_far` | Q11 | `height`
Q4 | `guess_TL_ht`  | Q12 | `hand_span`
Q5 | `smoke`        | Q13 | `color`
Q6 | `handedness`   | Q14 | `sleep`
Q7 | `stats_future` | Q15 | `pulse_rate`
Q8 | `haircut`      | -   | -


- At one time, I asked about `sex` rather than `glasses`.
- In prior years, people guessed my age, rather than height here.
- Sometimes, I've asked for a 30-second pulse check, then doubled.

## Response to the Question I asked

About how many of those 315 surveys caused *no problems* in recording responses?

> - Guesses?

> - 110/315 (35%) caused no problems.

# Guessing My Age <br /> from Class 01

## The R Packages I'll Load Today

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

library(janitor)
library(kableExtra)
library(googlesheets4)
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
```

- If you actually run this in R, you will get some messages which we will suppress and ignore today.

## From our Shared Google Drive

I've placed `class01_age_guesses_2022-08-30` on our Shared Google Drive.

![](c02/images/age_guess_sheet.png)

- Remember that you must log into Google via CWRU to see the Drive I've shared with you.
 
## Reading from Google Drive

We'll use the `read_sheet` function from the `googlesheets4` package to read in data from a Google Sheet. 

To do this, we copy the URL from the Google Sheet into a temporary object I'll call `temp_url`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
gs4_deauth() # lets us work with the file without extra authorization

temp_url <- 
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UMwBxg6CJfReYHNEauJSWmZSKma-DQlPYWNiN9-HcNM/edit#gid=0"
```

- For more on `gs4_deauth()`, visit [this link](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/gs4_deauth.html)

## Creating the `age_guess` Tibble

Then I'll read in the sheet's data to a new tibble called `age_guess` using `read_sheet()`. What do we get?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
age_guess <- read_sheet(temp_url)
age_guess
```

## What do the `guess1` values look like?

```{r}
#| echo: true
age_guess |> 
  select(guess1) |> 
  arrange(guess1) 
```

## Plot the `guess1` values?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(data = age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1)
```

## Can we make a histogram?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Improving the Histogram, 1

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) 
```

## Improving the Histogram, 2

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, 
        col = "yellow")
```

## Improving the Histogram, 3

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, 
       col = "white", 
       fill = "blue")
```

## Improving the Histogram, 4

Change theme, specify bin width rather than number of bins

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
       col = "white", fill = "blue") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Improving the Histogram, 5

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
       col = "white", fill = "blue") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "First Guess of Dr. Love's Age",
    y = "Fall 2022 431 students")
```

## Add title and subtitle (ver. 6)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
       col = "white", fill = "blue") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "First Guess of Dr. Love's Age",
    y = "Fall 2022 431 students",
    title = "Pretty wide range of guesses",
    subtitle = "Dr. Love's Actual Age = 55.5")
```

## Improving the Histogram, 7

Add a vertical line at 55.5 years to show my actual age.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(age_guess, 
       aes(x = guess1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, 
       col = "white", fill = "blue") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 55.5), col = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "First Guess of Dr. Love's Age",
    y = "Fall 2022 431 students",
    title = "Pretty wide range of guesses",
    subtitle = "Dr. Love's Actual Age = 55.5")
```

## Numerical Summary (I was 55.5)

```{r}
#| echo: true
summary(age_guess)
```

>- Was the average guess closer on guess 1 or 2?
>- What was the range of first guesses? Second guesses?
>- What does the `NA's : 3` mean in `guess2`?
>- Why is `student` not summarized any further?

## More Numerical Summaries

- Using the `favstats` function from the `mosaic` package

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
mosaic::favstats(~ guess1, data = age_guess)
mosaic::favstats(~ guess2, data = age_guess)
```

- Using the `describe` function from the `psych` package

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

age_guess |>
  select(guess1, guess2) |>
  psych::describe()
```

## Guesses between 50 and 60?

- Counting is an under-appreciated activity.

```{r}
#| echo: true
age_guess |> count(guess1 >= 50 & guess1 <= 60)
age_guess |> count(guess2 >= 50 & guess1 <= 60)
```

## Guess 1 - Guess 2 Scatterplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = age_guess, aes(x = guess1, y = guess2)) +
  geom_point() 
```

## Filter to complete cases, and add regression line

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
temp <- age_guess |>
  filter(complete.cases(guess1, guess2))

ggplot(data = temp, aes(x = guess1, y = guess2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, col = "purple")
```

## What is that regression line?

```{r}
lm(guess2 ~ guess1, data = age_guess)
```

- Note that `lm` filters to complete cases by default.

## How about a loess smooth curve?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
temp <- age_guess |>
  filter(complete.cases(guess1, guess2))

ggplot(data = temp, aes(x = guess1, y = guess2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, col = "blue") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Add y = x line (no change in guess)?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
temp <- age_guess |>
  filter(complete.cases(guess1, guess2))

ggplot(data = temp, aes(x = guess1, y = guess2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, col = "blue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") +
  theme_bw()
```

## With Better Labels

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

ggplot(data = temp, aes(x = guess1, y = guess2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, col = "blue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") +
  geom_text(x = 40, y = 38, label = "y = x", col = "red") +
  labs(x = "First Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       title = "Comparing 2022 Age Guesses",
       subtitle = "Love's actual age = 55.5") +
  theme_bw()
```

## How did guesses change?

- Did your guesses decrease / stay the same / increase?
- Calculate guess2 - guess1 and examine its sign.

```{r}
#| echo: true
age_guess |> 
  count(sign(guess2 - guess1))
```

## How much did guesses change?

Create new variable (change = guess2 - guess1)

```{r}
#| echo: true
age_guess <- age_guess |>
  mutate(change = guess2 - guess1)

age_guess |> select(change) |> summary()
```

## Table (via `tabyl`) of guess changes

```{r}
#| echo: true
age_guess |>
  tabyl(change) |> 
  adorn_pct_formatting()
```

## Dotplot of guess changes

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(data = age_guess, aes(x = change)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1, dotsize = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Histogram of Guess Changes

What will this look like?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| output-location: slide
ggplot(data = age_guess, aes(x = change)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "royalblue", col = "yellow") + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Change from first to second guess",
       y = "Number of students (431 in Fall 2021)",
       title = "Most stayed close to their first guess.")
```

## What Happens Next Time?

To be announced.
