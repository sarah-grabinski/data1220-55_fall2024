## Chatfield's Six Rules for Data Analysis

1.  *Do not attempt to analyze the data until you understand what is being measured and why.*
2.  *Find out how the data were collected.*
3.  *Look at the structure of the data.*
4.  *Carefully examine the data in an exploratory way, before attempting a more sophisticated analysis.*
5.  *Use your common sense at all times.*
6.  *Report the results in a clear, self-explanatory way.*

*Chatfield, Chris (1996) Problem Solving: A Statistician's Guide, 2nd ed.*
