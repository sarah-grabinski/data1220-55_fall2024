## Homework 2

-   Describing numerical distributions: modality, skew, outliers

-   Describing numerical distributions: appropriate summary statistics

-   Matching numerical distributions to their summary statistics, reading a boxplot

-   Calculating proportions from a contingency table

## Homework 2 {.smaller}

-   [Instructions](https://canvas.jcu.edu/files/3708401/download?download_frd=1) (`homework2_instructions.pdf`), a [Quarto markdown template](https://canvas.jcu.edu/files/3708307/download?download_frd=1) (`homework2_template.qmd`), and an [example HTML output](https://canvas.jcu.edu/files/3708306/download?download_frd=1) (`homework2_example.html`) are available for download under Chapter 2 on the [Modules](https://canvas.jcu.edu/courses/36290/modules) page in Canvas.

-   Upload ***TWO*** (2) documents to [Homework 2](https://canvas.jcu.edu/courses/36290/assignments/451733) on the [Assignments](https://canvas.jcu.edu/courses/36290/assignments) page in Canvas by ***Friday 9/20/2024*** by ***6:00pm***: `homework2_yourlastname.qmd` and `homework2_yourlastname.html`

-   [Video walk-through](https://canvas.jcu.edu/files/3708369/download?download_frd=1) of Homework 2 under Tutorials on the [Modules](https://canvas.jcu.edu/courses/36290/modules) page in Canvas. Make sure you're caught up on the [video walk-through of homework 1](https://canvas.jcu.edu/files/3695568/download?download_frd=1).

## Late Policy

"This homework is due by 6:00pm on Friday, 9/20/24. No credit will be lost for assignments received by 7:00pm to account for issues with uploading. 10% of the points will be deducted from assignments received by 9:00am on Saturday, 9/21/24. Assignments turned in after this point are only eligible for 50% credit, so it benefits you to turn in whatever you have completed by the due date."

## How can I get help with homework? {.smaller}

-   ***Read the [textbook](https://canvas.jcu.edu/files/3669904/download?download_frd=1).*** Many of you are asking for additional examples. Luckily, there are tons we didn't go over in the textbook.

-   ***Look at the [homework](https://canvas.jcu.edu/courses/36290/assignments/451733) early***. I can see in Canvas that many students didn't download the documents until 1-2 days before it was due. That's not a lot of time to get help.

-   ***Ask a question on our [Campuswire class feed](https://campuswire.com/c/G6427C531/feed).*** I'm only one person, and I may not be able to give you a prompt answer. However, the 20+ other people in the class might be able to.

-   ***Come to office hours.*** I will be available after class today (Monday 9/23/2024) and Wednesday 9/25/2024 from 2:30pm - 4:00pm. If you cannot make it, reach out to me to try and schedule an appointment.

## Last Time...

-   Contingency tables: counts and proportions (frequencies)

-   Visualizing frequencies: bar plots, mosaic plots

-   Describing numerical relationships: linear vs nonlinear, strong vs weak

-   Visualizing 3+ variables

## Chapter 3 Objectives

-   Define probability, random processes, and the law of large numbers

-   Describe the sample space for disjoint and non-disjoint outcomes

-   Calculate probabilities using the General Addition and Multiplication Rules

-   Create a probability distribution for disjoint outcomes

## Defining Probability

What does the word ***probability*** mean to you?

. . .

*"Highly likely"*

. . .

*"Probably"*

. . .

*"About even"*

. . .

*"Almost no chance"*

## People interpret probability differently 

![Did your estimate fall within these ranges? Are these ranges reasonable?](https://github.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/blob/main/slides/class08/perceptions-of-probability.PNG?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## So what is probability?

::: callout-note
## Frequentist Definition

The proportion of times that a particular outcome would occur if we observed a random process an infinite number of times.
:::

-   A ***random process*** is one where you know which outcomes are possible (i.e. the ***sample space***) but you don't know which outcome comes next

-   Examples of a ***random process***: coin toss, die roll, stock market
