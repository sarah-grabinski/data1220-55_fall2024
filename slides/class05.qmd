## Request

Could you put "DATA1220: " at the beginning of the subject line of your emails?

I have 3 emails, and this will help me spot and respond to yours more quickly.

## Reminder: Homework

Late policy: "This homework is due by 6:00pm on Monday, 9/9/24. No credit will be lost for assignments received by 7:00pm to account for issues with uploading. 10% of the points will be deducted from assignments received by 9:00am on Tuesday, 9/10/24. Assignments turned in after this point are only eligible for 50% credit, so it benefits you to turn in whatever you have completed by the due date."

## Numerical Variables

![Numerical variables can be continuous or discrete.](class03/types_of_data.png){fig-alt="Flow chart with all variables being split into numerical and categorical variables. Numerical is further subdivided into continuous and discrete. Categorical is subdivided into nominal or ordinal." fig-align="center"}

## Describing numerical distributions

The "shape" of numerical data is called its ***distribution***.

-   ***Location:*** the "center" of the data

-   ***Scale:*** the "spread" of the data

## Describing a distribution's ***location***

The ***location*** of a numerical variable's distribution can be thought of as the "center" of the data, around which the bulk of the observations cluster.

-   ***Mean:*** the sum of a values divided by the number of observations (i.e. "average")

-   ***Median:*** the value in the exact middle of the data

-   ***Mode:*** the most common value in the data (for discrete variables)

## The Mean (Average)

*Where are the bulk of observations concentrated?*

The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is computed as the sum of all observed values $\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}$, where $i$ is the observation number, divided by the total number of observations $n$.

$$
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
$$

or

$$
\bar{x}=\frac{\operatorname{sum}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)}{n}=\frac{x_1+x_2+...+x_n}{n}
$$

## Calculating the mean in R

```{r echo = F}
set.seed(123); x <- round(rnorm(10, mean = 5, sd = 2))
```

Consider the numerical variable `x`.

```{r}
x

length(x)
```

## Calculating the mean in R

You can calculate the mean manually...

```{r}
(4 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 4) / length(x)
```

Or you can use the `mean()` function.

```{r}
mean(x, 
     na.rm = T) # this parameter ignores missing values
```

## Sample vs Population Mean

The ***sample mean*** is denoted as $\bar{x}$. The population mean is denoted $\mu$. They are calculated the same way.

The ***sample mean*** is considered to be a good ***point estimate*** of the ***population mean*** if the sample population is *representative* of the study/target population.

*What makes for a good sample?*

## The Median

The ***median*** is the middle value when the data are sorted in order.

-   When the number of observations $n$ is odd, this works as stated.

-   When the number of observations $n$ is even, the median is calculated as the mean of the 2 middle values.

## Calculating the median in R

```{r}
# Sort the data in order from least to most
sort(x)
```

```{r}
(5 + 5) / 2
```

```{r}
median(x)
```

## Describing a distribution's ***scale***

*How far is each data value from the mean?*

-   ***Variance:*** $s^2$, the sum of the squared differences between each observation's value and the sample mean $\bar{x}$ divided by $n-1$

-   ***Standard deviation:*** $s$, the square root of the variance

-   ***Range:*** minimum to maximum

-   ***Interquartile Range (IQR):*** 25th percentile to 75th percentile

## The Variance

The ***deviance*** is how far each data value is from the mean. The ***variance***, denoted as $s^2$, is the squared sum of all observation ***deviations*** $\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\bar{y})^2$ where $i$ is the observation number, divided by $n-1$.

$$
\operatorname{Variance}=s^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\bar{y})^2}{n-1}
$$

## Calculating the variance in R

```{r}
var(x)
```

## The Standard Deviation

The ***standard deviation*** is the square root of the variance, and is interpreted in the original unit of measurement for that variable.

$$
\operatorname{Standard Deviation}=s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}
$$

## Calculating the standard deviation in R

```{r}
sd(x, na.rm = T)
```

## The Range

The ***range*** of the data is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value.

$$
\operatorname{Range}=\operatorname{max}(x)-\operatorname{min}(x)
$$

## Calculating the range in R

```{r}
max(x) - min(x)
```

```{r}
range(x)
```

## The Interquartile Range (IQR)

-   The 25th percentile of the data is called the ***first quartile*** or ***Q1***

-   The 50th percentile of the data is called the ***median***

-   The 75th percentile of the data is called the ***third quartile*** or ***Q3***

-   The range between ***Q3*** and ***Q1*** is called the ***interquartile range*** or ***IQR***.

$$
\operatorname{IQR}=\operatorname{Q3}-\operatorname{Q1}
$$

## Calculating the interquartile range in R

```{r}
c(quantile(x, 0.25), quantile(x, 0.75))
```

```{r}
quantile(x, 0.75) - quantile(x, 0.25)
```

```{r}
IQR(x)
```

## Outliers

![](class05/outlier.png){fig-align="center"}

## How do skew and outliers affect numerical summary statistics?

![The presence of outliers and/or skew in a numerical variable's distribution affects how well summary statistics describe a distribution's location.](class05/outlier_statistics.png)

## Robust statistics

The ***median*** and ***interquartile range*** are considered to be ***robust statistics*** for the numerical summary of data because they are less sensitive to ***skew*** and ***outliers*** than the ***mean***, ***variance***, and ***standard deviation***.
