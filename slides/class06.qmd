## Numerical Variables

![Numerical variables can be continuous or discrete.](class03/types_of_data.png){fig-alt="Flow chart with all variables being split into numerical and categorical variables. Numerical is further subdivided into continuous and discrete. Categorical is subdivided into nominal or ordinal." fig-align="center"}

## Describing numerical distributions

The "shape" of numerical data is called its **distribution**.

-   **Location:** the "center" of the data

    -   The value(s) around which most observations are clustered

-   **Scale:** the "spread" of the data

    -   How variable the observations are around that "center"

## Describing distribution shapes

![Commonly observed patterns in numerical distributions](class05/distribution_shapes.png){fig-align="center"}

## Describing a distribution's **location**

The **location** of a numerical variable's distribution can be thought of as the "center" of the data, around which the bulk of the observations cluster.

-   **Mean:** the sum of a values divided by the number of observations (i.e. "average")

-   **Median:** the value in the exact middle of the data

-   **Mode:** the most common value in the data (for discrete variables)

## Describing a distribution's **scale**

How far is each data value from the mean?

-   **Variance:** $s^2$, the sum of the squared differences between each observation's value and the sample mean $\bar{x}$ divided by $n-1$

-   **Standard deviation:** $s$, the square root of the variance

-   **Range:** minimum to maximum

-   **Interquartile Range (IQR):** 25th percentile to 75th percentile, the middle 50% of the data

## Robust statistics

The **median** and **interquartile range** are considered to be **robust statistics** for the numerical summary of data because they are less sensitive to **skew** and **outliers** than the **mean**, **variance**, and **standard deviation**.

![The presence of outliers and/or skew in a numerical variable's distribution affects how well summary statistics describe a distribution's location.](class05/outlier_statistics.png)

## 5-Number Summary of Numerical Data

1.  Minimum value or Q1 - 1.5 x Interquartile Region

2.  1st quartile (Q1, 25th percentile)

3.  Median (Q2, 50th percentile)

4.  3rd quartile (Q3, 75th percentile)

5.  Maximum value or Q3 + 1.5 x Interquartile Region

## Choosing Summary Statistics for Numerical Data

-   The **mean** and **standard deviation** are really only appropriate for a certain type of unimodal, symmetric distribution called the **normal distribution** and often misused

-   Most real world data will be best described by the **median** and **interquartile region** as part of a 5-number summary

## The Normal Distribution

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![The percentage of the observations which fall within +/- 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean when data is normally distributed.](class06/standard-normal-distribution-example.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Normal distributions** are unimodal and symmetric

-   The **mean** and the **median** of normally distributed data will be approximately equal

-   **Normally distributed** variables are desirable in statistics but rare in practice
:::
:::

## Using the mean +/- standard deviation to describe non-normal distributions

![All of these distributions have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, but those metrics are only appropriate for describing the middle distribution.](class06/mean_and_sd_non_normal.png){fig-align="center"}

## Visualizing Numerical Data

-   Dot plot

-   Histogram

-   Density Curve

-   Boxplot

-   Violin plot

## How to Read a Dot Plot

![There is a single axis (x) along with a dot marking each data point. The points are usually slightly transparent, so you can see when points are overlapping.](class06/dot_plot.png)

## How to read a stacked dot plot

![In a stacked dot plot, multiple observations at a single value are stacked on top of each other.](class06/stacked_dot.png){fig-align="center"}

## How to Read a Histogram

![](class06/histogram_example.png){fig-align="center"}

## Histograms for different distributions

![Examples of the different distribution shapes as histograms](class06/histogram_distributions.png)

## Histograms and skew

![When histograms are skewed, the mean and the median may occur in 2 different bins.](class06/histogram_summary_statistics.png)

## Histograms and outliers

![Outliers are easy to spot on a histogram](class06/histogram_outliers.png)

## Histograms and modality

![Modality is easy to spot on a histogram.](class06/histogram_modality.png)

## Choosing a bin width for your histogram

![Bins that are too narrow may produce gaps. Bins that are too wide can hide the "shape" of the distribution.](class06/histogram_binwidth.png)

## Histograms –\> Density Plots

![Density plots produce a smooth curve of the distribution across all values of the numerical variable. While a histogram represents the count of observations that fall within a particular range, density represents the % of observations that occur at that specific value of the variable.](class06/histogram_density.png)

## All together now

## Anatomy of a Boxplot

![A boxplot is a visual representation of a 5-number summary. The "box" represents the middle 50% of the data, or the interquartile range. The line inside the box indicates the median or 50th percentile. The whiskers, the lines coming out from the box, extend 1.5 x IQR beyond Q1 and Q3. Values larger or smaller than that range are classified as outliers and appear as points.](class06/boxplot_anatomy.png)

## Boxplot whiskers and outliers

-   The ***whiskers*** of a boxplot (the lines extending out from the box) are 1.5 times the ***interquartile region*** long

    -   Min whisker: Q1 - 1.5 x IQR

    -   Max whisker: Q3 + 1.5 x IQR

-   If a point is outside this range, it is considered to be a potential ***outlier***

## Combining strategies: density + numerical summary

![Because it's hard to spot modality in a box plot, they are often combined with density curves or violin plots.](class06/violin_boxplot.png)

## Combining strategies: violin + boxplot

![Some visualizations add a point to the boxplot indicating the location of the mean. If the mean is meaningfully different than the median, you have outliers and/or a skewed distribution.](class06/violin_boxplot_example.png)

## Combining strategies: raincloud plots

![Raincloud plots combine density curves, boxplots, and stacked dot plots. Can you see why having all 3 improves your understanding of the data?](class06/raincloud-slab-1.png)

## Distribution Checklist {.smaller}

-   What is the **modality** of the distribution?

    -   How many "peaks" are there?

-   Is the distribution **skewed** or **symmetric**?

    -   Is there a longer "tail" on the left or right side?

-   Are there any **outliers**?

    -   How extreme are the most extreme values?

-   What are the appropriate **summary statistics** for a distribution with this shape?

    -   Would the mean+standard deviation or the median+IQR more accurately describe this data?

## Example: The Penguins!

![What is the modality of each distribution? Are they skewed? Would the mean be greater than, lesser than, or about equal to the median? Are there any outliers?](class06/polished-penguins-1.png)

## Example: `datasets::iris` data set

![Describe the shape of these different distributions. Do any of them look normally distributed?](class06/iris_example1.png)

## Example: `datasets::iris` data set

![When a distribution has multiple modes or is unusually distributed, it may be better to visualize the data separated by a categorical variable.](class06/iris_example2.png)
