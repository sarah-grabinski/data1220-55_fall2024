## Types of Data

![The two primary types of data we'll analyze are numerical and categorical variables.](class03/types_of_data.png){fig-alt="Flow chart with all variables being split into numerical and categorical variables. Numerical is further subdivided into continuous and discrete. Categorical is subdivided into nominal or ordinal." fig-align="center"}

## How can I tell what kind of variable I have?

-   Inspect the data in the global environment

-   Print the data to the console or in a code chunk

-   Use the `glimpse()` function for a quick summary

-   Use the `describe()` function from the `Hmisc` package for a detailed summary

## Let's work with `palmerpenguins`!

![Meet the Palmer Penguins](class02/lter_penguins.png){fig-align="center"}

## Load the `palmerpenguins::penguins_df`data set

```{r}
penguins_df <- palmerpenguins::penguins

head(penguins_df)
```

## Data Dictionary

| name             | description                                | variable type         |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| `species`        | Penguin species: chinstrap, gentoo, adelie | categorical           |
| `bill_length_mm` | how long is the bill from base to tip      | numerical, continuous |
| `bill_depth_mm`  | how wide is the bill from bottom to top    | numerical             |

## Use `Hmisc::describe()` for a detailed summary

```{r, eval = F}
# describe is a common function name, so 
# it is a good habit to call this version
# directly from the package using package_name::
# to prevent conflicts and errors
penguins_df |>
  select(species, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) |>
  Hmisc::describe()
```

## Use `Hmisc::describe()` for a detailed summary

```{r, echo = F}
penguins_df |>   
  select(species, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) |>   
  Hmisc::describe()
```

## Visualizing Data

-   Distributions and numerical summaries of both explanatory and response variables

    -   Histogram, bar plot

    -   Density or violin plots

    -   Boxplots

-   Associations, relationships, correlations between explanatory and response variables

    -   Scatter plots, regression

    -   Scatterplot matrices

## Variable Terms

-   ***Independent*** or ***explanatory*** variable

    -   Typically on the x-axis

    -   "Cause" variable

-   ***Dependent*** or ***response*** variable

    -   Typically on the y-axis

    -   "Effect" variable

## Association vs. Independence

-   When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called ***associated*** variables.

-   If two variables are not associated, i.e. there is no evident connection between the two, then they are said to be ***independent***.

## Scatterplot Matrices - Quick Look at Many Relationships

This code will sometimes run slowly and generate lots of warning messages.

```{r, eval = F}
penguins_df |>
# Select variables of interest
  select(species, bill_length_mm,
         bill_depth_mm) |>
  # send to ggpairs to create the matrix
  ggpairs()
```

```{r, eval = F}
# Pipe data into ggplot2
penguins_df |>
  # Set x and y variables with aes
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
             y = bill_length_mm)) +
  # add a scatterplot
  geom_point() +
  # add a linear model regression line
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, 
              # set method to lm
              method = 'lm', 
              # keep standard error shading
              se = T)
```

## Scatter plot + Linear Regression - Detailed Look at 1 Relationship

Does this look like this regression line accurately describes the relationship between bill depth and bill length? Do you see any patterns in the points?

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
# Pipe data into ggplot2
penguins_df |>
  # Set x and y variables with aes
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
             y = bill_length_mm)) +
  # add a scatterplot
  geom_point() +
  # add a linear model regression line

              # set method to lm
              method = 'lm', 
              # keep standard error shading
              se = T)
```

              # remove standard error shading
              se = F)
```

## Scatter plot + LOESS Regression - Detailed Look at 1 Relationship

Using the localized regression technique LOESS can help you identify trends in your data that traditional linear models can miss. What do you see here?

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
# Pipe data into ggplot2
penguins_df |>
  # Set x and y variables with aes
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
             y = bill_length_mm)) +
  # add a scatterplot
  geom_point() +
  # add a LOESS regression line
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, 
              # set method to loess
              method = 'loess', 
              # change the color
              color = 'red',
              # remove standard error shading
              se = F)
```

## What happens when we consider penguin species?

How does this plot differ from the first linear regression analysis on data from `penguins_df` not grouped by species?

# Pipe data into ggplot2

  # Set x and y variables with aes
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm,
             y = bill_length_mm, 
             # group the data by species
             group = species, 
             # color the points/lines by species
             color = species)) +
  # add a scatterplot

## Take-Home Lessons

-   Conclusions are shaped by the assumptions we make during the analysis

-   Context is important!

-   A picture is worth a thousand words

## Study Approaches {.small}

-   **Case Study (anecdotal evidence)**: very few observations, often $n = 1$

-   **Sampling**: a subset of all possible observations

    -   **Random**: a sampling technique used to obtain data from the subset that is representative of all possible observations

    -   **Voluntary response**: data is volunteered by study subjects

    -   **Convenience**: data is obtained from the subset of all possible observations that is most easily accessible

-   **Census**: all possible observations

## Study Methods {.smaller}

-   **Observational Study**: researchers do not affect the data that is collected from subjects (ex: a political poll)

-   **Interventional Study**: researchers do *something* which modifies the data collected from subjects (ex: a clinical trial that assigns subjects to control and treatment groups)

-   **Prospective Study**: subjects are recruited into a study prior to future data collections (ex: a 5-year study of crime rates in juveniles following expulsion from school)

-   **Retrospective Study**: data is collected from subjects on events that have already taken place (ex: a study of the past medical records of hospital patients who were diagnosed with a disease)

## Study Population Definitions

-   **Study Population**: all possible subjects who could have been observed in the study

-   **Sample Population**: the subjects who were actually observed in the study

-   **Target Population**: the subjects who the research conclusions should be applied to

## Evaluating a Study's Data

-   **Reliability**: how much can we trust the data? is it accurate?

-   **Validity**: how well does the sample population represent the study population?

-   **Generalizability**: would the conclusions from the study population be applicable to the target population?

:::

::: column
You're a researcher with the FDA investigating the safety of food additives. Some skittles are made with Red 40, a food dye. This additive can harm the body in large doses, so you want to make sure people who eat Skittles don't get too much. You need to know on average how many red skittles come in a package to determine if levels are below the legal limit.
:::
:::

## Research Question

On average, how many red Skittles are in the a package?

## What is being measured?

Count of red skittles in a package

## Sampling Strategy

-   Where will we get Skittles to study from?

-   How many packages should we count?

## Target Population

-   To what or whom will the conclusions of our study apply?

-   How does that affect data collection?

## Population Definitions

-   What is the study population?

-   What is the sample population?

## Evaluating Inferences

-   How reliable would data collected this way be?

-   How valid would data collected this way be?

-   To whom/what is the data generalizable?
