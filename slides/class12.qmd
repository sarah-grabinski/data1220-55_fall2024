## Probability Review

-   (General) Addition Rule

-   (General) Multiplication Rule

-   Dependence vs Independence

## The General Addition Rule

The probability of event A ***or*** event B occurring is the sum of the probability that A occurs and the probability that B occurs minus the probability that A *and* B occurs.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{or} B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \operatorname{and} B) \\
&= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B) \\
&= P(A \cap B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## The Addition Rule for Disjoint Events

When events A and B are ***disjoint***, the probability of event A ***or*** event B occurring is just the sum of the probability that A occurs and the probability that B occurs, because the probability that event A *and* event B occurs is 0.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{or} B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \operatorname{and} B) \\
&= P(A) + P(B) \\
&= P(A \cap B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## The General Multiplication Rule

The probability of event A ***and*** event B occurring is the product of the probability that A occurs and the *conditional probability* that B occurs given that A has already occurred.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{and} B) &= P(A) \times P(B \operatorname{given} A) \\
&= P(A) \times P(B | A) \\
&= P(A \cup B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Independent Processes

-   If random process B is ***independent*** of random process A, then the probability of random process B does NOT vary based on the outcome of random process A

-   *i.e. knowing the outcome of A does NOT provide additional information about the probability of B*

-   Example: When listening to a playlist using a "true shuffle", the probability that the next song will be by a particular artist *does not* change based on whether or not the last song played was also by that artist.

## Multiplication Rule for Independent Processes

The probability of event A ***and*** event B occurring is the product of the probability that A occurs and the probability that B occurs, because the probability of B does not change based on the outcome of A.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{and} B) &= P(A) \times P(B \operatorname{given} A) \\
&= P(A) \times P(B | A) \\
&= P(A) \times P(B) \\
&= P(A \cup B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## How do you know if two random processes are independent? {.smaller}

-   Compare the conditional probabilities of B given the different possible outcomes of A. If $P(B|A)\approx P(B)$ for all values of A, then the two random processes are likely independent.

-   Calculate the probability that event A and B occur under both an independence model ($P(A \operatorname{and} B)=P(A)\times P(B)$) and a dependence model ($P(A \operatorname{and} B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$.

    -   If $P(A)\times P(B) \approx P(A) \times P(B|A)$, then A and B are likely ***independent processes***.
    -   If $P(A)\times P(B) \neq P(A) \times P(B|A)$, then A and B are likely ***dependent*** processes.

## Practice: Swing Voters

-   Pew Research survey asked 2,373 randomly sampled registered voters about their...

    -   Political affilitation (Democrat, Republican, Independent)

    -   Whether they consider themselves a swing voter (Yes, No)

-   35% responded Independent, 23% identified as swing voters, and 11% identified as both

## Pratice: Swing Voters {.smaller}

-   Are these events disjoint or non-disjoint?

-   What does the sample space look like?

-   What do the contingency tables look like?

-   What % of voters identify as an Independent *or* a swing voter?

-   What % of voters identify as *neither* an Independent *nor* a swing voter?

-   Are identifying as an Independent and identifying as a swing voter dependent or independent processes?

## Pratice: Poverty and Language

The American Community Survey (ACS) provides public data each year to give communities demographic information to plan investments and services. The 2010 ACS estimates that...

-   14.6% of Americans live below the poverty line

-   20.7% of Americans speak a language other than English at home

-   31.1% of Americans live below the poverty line *or* speak a language other than English at home

## Pratice: Poverty and Language {.smaller}

-   Are these events disjoint or non-disjoint?

-   What does the sample space look like?

-   What do the contingency tables look like?

-   What % of Americans live below the poverty line *and* speak a language other than English at home?

-   What % of Americans live below the poverty line *and* speak only English at home?

-   Are living below the poverty line and speaking a language other than English at home dependent or independent?

## Chapter 4 - Distributions {.smaller}

-   We will *only* be covering Chapter 4.1 on the normal distribution in your [textbook]()

-   If you have an interest in math or statistics, you may want to read the rest of Chapter 4

    -   4.2 - Geometric distribution

    -   4.3 - Binomial distribution

    -   4.4 - Negative binomial distribution

    -   4.5 - Poisson distribution

## Chapter 4 Objectives

-   Identify and describe the standard normal and normal distributions

-   Standardize normal distributions and calculate Z-scores

-   Calculate percentiles and exact probabilities

-   Apply the 68-95-99.7 Rule

-   Read a QQ-Plot (not in book)

## The Normal Distribution

::: columns
::: column
-   Symmetric, unimodal, "bell-shaped"

-   Not as common as people think in real data

-   Strong assumption in small sample sizes (\$\le 20)

-   Powerful statistical tests available when outcome approximates normal distribution

## Notation

-   $\mu$ (Greek letter mu) represents the mean

-   $\sigma$ (Greek letter sigma) represents the standard deviation of the mean

-   $N(\mu, \sigma)$ stands for a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$

## Histograms and Density Curves

![Vocabulary scores for 947 seventh-graders. Both histograms and density curves can be helpful in identifying normal distributions.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/height-of-males.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Example: OkCupid, Heights of Males

![Dashed line is self-reported heights by females on OkCupid. Dark purple line is the normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. Light purple line is the US average.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/height-of-females.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## The shape of a normal distribution varies by location (mean) and scale (standard deviation)

![Changing the mean shifts the "center" of the distribution. Changing the standard deviation alters the "width" of the distribution (i.e. variability).](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/means-and-sds.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Standardizing Normal Distributions with Z-Scores

-   A ***Z-score*** is the number of standard deviations a value falls above (when positive) or below (when negative) the mean of the data

-   Z-scores standardize a normal distribution by...

    -   Centering the data at 0 by subtracting the mean from each score

    -   Scaling the units of the data to 1 by dividing the centered data by the standard deviation

## Calculating the Z-Score

$$
\begin{aligned}
Z&=\frac{\operatorname{observed value}-\operatorname{mean}}{\operatorname{standard deviation}} \\
&= \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example: Test Scores

-   SAT scores are normally distributed with $\mu=1500$ and $\sigma=300$ ($N(\mu=1500, \sigma = 300)$)

-   ACT scores are normally distributed with $\mu=21$ and $\sigma=5$ ($N(21, 5)$)

![How do we compare normal distributions with different locations and scales?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/percentiles-example.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Visualizing Z-Scores

![Standardizing the data by converting values to Z-scores puts different distributions on the same scale.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/percentiles-example.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## The Standard Normal Distribution

-   The ***standard normal distribution*** is a normal distribution with $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$ (written $N(\mu=0, \sigma=1)$)

-   Units of the standard normal distribution are standard deviations (Z-scores) (i.e. 1 unit = 1 SD)

-   Observations that are 2+ standard deviations from the mean are considered unusual

## The 68-95-99.7 Rule

When data is (nearly) normally distributed...

-   \~68% of the observations are within 1 standard deviation of the mean ($\mu \pm \sigma$)

-   \~95% of the observations are within 2 standard deviations of the mean ($\mu \pm 2\sigma$)

-   99.7% of the observations are within 3 standard deviations of the mean ($\mu \pm 3\sigma$)

## The 68-95-99.7 Rule

![The 68-95-99.7 Rule describes approximately what proportion of the observations should lie within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean respectively, if the data is normally distributed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/68-95-99.7-rule.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Example: Test Scores

::: columns
::: column
-   SAT scores have the distribution $N(1500, 300)$

-   \~68% of scores will be 1200-1800

-   95% of scores will be 900-2100

-   99.7% of scores will be 600-2400

## Proportions, Probabilities, and Percentiles

![A ***percentile*** is the proportion or percentage of observations that fall *below* a given value in a distribution.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/percentile-shaded-left.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Calculating Percentiles with Z-Score Tables

![You can use a Z-Score Table to look up the percentile that corresponds to a particular Z-Score.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/z-score-table.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Example: Discrete Numeric Variables

![Sometimes the normal distribution is an acceptable approximation of a discrete numeric variable, but other distributions may be more appropriate.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/hours-of-sleep.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Example: QQ-Plot

![Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plots can help easily identify when you can and cannot assume normality.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class12/qq-plots.jpg?raw=true){fig-align="center"}
