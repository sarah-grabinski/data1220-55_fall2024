## Point Estimates and Population Parameters

Why can we use the ***sample statistic*** (e.g. sample mean $\bar{x}$, standard deviation $s$) as ***point estimates*** for the ***population parameters*** (e.g. population mean $\mu$, population standard deviation $\sigma$)?

## Building Models

![Statistical analysis requires making assumptions about the world around us which may or may not be true.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class15/george-box.jpg?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## What are you assuming? (The Model)

::: callout-warning
## ASSUMPTION
::: larger
The probability distribution of a random process follows a known distribution (e.g. a ***normal distribution***), which we can model and from which we can draw inferences about the parameters which govern that process.
:::
:::

## What are you assuming? (Reliability)

::: callout-warning
## ASSUMPTION

We have collected enough data and that data is trustworthy enough that our ***sample statistics*** are ***reliable*** estimators of the "ground truth" in our sample population.
:::

## What are you assuming? (Validity)

::: callout-warning
## ASSUMPTION

Our sample population is sufficiently representative of our study population such that our ***sample statistics*** are ***valid*** estimators of the ***population parameters*** in our study population.
:::

## What are you assuming? (Generalizability)

::: callout-warning
## ASSUMPTION

Our study population is sufficiently representative of our target population such that ***inferences*** about the ***population parameters*** of our study population are ***generalizable*** to our target population.
:::

## Accuracy vs Precision

-   Accuracy describes how similar a sample statistic is to the "true" population parameter

-   Precision describes how similar the sample statistics in a sampling distribution are to each other (i.e. the variability of the estimates)

## Accuracy vs Precision

![Contingency Table for Accurate and/or Precise Outcomes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class15/accuracy-vs-precision.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Why do we talk so much about study/sample/target populations? {.smaller}

-   ***Reliable*** data $\rightarrow$ sample statistics are ***accurate*** estimators of sample population parameters

-   ***Valid*** data $\rightarrow$ sample statistics are ***accurate*** estimators of sampling distribution in study population

-   ***Generalizable*** data $\rightarrow$ sampling distribution of study population is ***accurate*** estimator of sampling distribution in target population

## Why do we talk so much about study design?

-   ***Larger samples*** $\rightarrow$ less variability $\rightarrow$ more ***precise*** estimates

-   More representative samples $\rightarrow$ less biased estimates $\rightarrow$ more ***accurate*** estimates

## Accuracy and Precision of Distributions

![What do we mean when we say that sampling statistics and distributions are accurate and/or precise?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class15/Accuracy-And-Precision-distributions.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## What is a confidence interval?

A ***confidence interval*** is a numerical range *inside* which a sample statistic is expected to occur with a given probability $1-\alpha$ (alpha) in any theoretical sample from a given population 

-   $1-\alpha$ is the ***confidence level*** and is often expressed as a %

-   ***This is only true if your assumptions about the population hold.***

## What is alpha ($\alpha$)?

-   $\alpha$ is called the ***confidence threshold*** 

-   The sample statistic is expected to occur *outside* the ***confidence interval*** with probability $\alpha$

-   A.K.A the ***Type I Error Rate*** or ***False Discovery Rate***

## Point Estimates vs Confidence Intervals

-   Point estimates are more ***precise*** than confidence intervals, but they are less likely to be ***accurate***

-   Confidence intervals are more likely to be ***accurate*** than point estimates, but they are less ***precise***

## Using both is best!

-   A ***point estimate*** describes the ***location*** of an estimate or parameter's distribution

-   A ***confidence interval*** describes the ***scale*** of an estimate or parameter's distribution

-   The ***confidence threshold*** describes our uncertainty regarding these values

## Choosing a Confidence Level

Choosing a ***confidence*** threshold $\alpha$ (alpha) is a trade-off between accuracy and precision.

-   As confidence increases ($\alpha \to 0$), ***accuracy*** increases

-   As confidence increases ($\alpha \to 0$), ***precision*** decreases

## Practice: Confidence Intervals

Will a 95% confidence interval be wider (i.e. larger range) or narrower than a 90% confidence interval?

. . .

:::larger
Wider
:::

## Practice: Precision

Which is a more ***precise*** estimator: a 95% or 90% confidence interval?

. . .

::: larger
90% CI
:::

## Practice: Confidence Intervals

Will a 95% confidence interval be wider (i.e. larger range) or narrower than a 99% confidence interval?

. . .

::: larger
Narrower
:::

## Practice: Accuracy

Which is more likely to be an ***accurate*** estimator: a 95% or 99% confidence interval?

. . .

::: larger
99% CI, ***if your assumptions hold***
:::

## How do we construct confidence intervals?

![Properties of known distributions, like the 68-95-99.7 Rule, are used to calculate the bounds of a confidence interval.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/refs/heads/main/slides/class15/ci-probability-distribution?raw=true){fig-align="center"}
