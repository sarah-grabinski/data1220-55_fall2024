## Accuracy vs Precision

-   Accuracy describes how similar the estimates in a sampling distribution are to the "true" population parameter

-   Precision describes how similar the estimates in a sampling distribution are to each other (i.e. the variability of the estimates)

## Point Estimates and Population Parameters

Why do we use the ***sample statistic*** (e.g. sample mean $\bar{x}$, standard deviation $s$) as ***point estimates*** for the ***population parameters*** (e.g. population mean $\mu$, population standard deviation $\sigma$)?

::: callout-warning
## ASSUMPTION
We have collected enough data and that data is trustworthy enough that our ***sample statistics*** are ***reliable*** estimators of the "ground truth" in our sample population.

::: callout-warning
## ASSUMPTION
Our sample population is sufficiently representative of our study population such that our ***sample statistics*** are ***valid*** estimators of the ***population parameters*** in our study population.

## ASSUMPTION
Our study population is sufficiently representative of our target population such that ***inferences*** about the ***population parameters*** of our study population are ***generalizable*** to our target population.
