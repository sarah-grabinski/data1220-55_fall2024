# Statistical Analysis Workflow

Many basic data analyses follow a workflow similar to the one outlined below. This document will go through each step and outline

1.  Develop research question.

2.  Identify target, study, and sample populations.

3.  Collect data / take sample.

4.  Check assumptions.

5.  Calculate sample statistics for sample.

6.  Infer the sampling distribution of the study population from the sample statistics.

7.  Test a hypothesis.

8.  Apply results to target population.
