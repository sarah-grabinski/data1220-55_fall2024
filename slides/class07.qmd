## Last time...

-   The ***normal distribution*** and when to use the ***mean + standard deviation***

-   ***Robust statistics*** and when to use the ***median + interquartile range***

-   The ***5-number summary*** and ***how to read a boxplot***

-   Other distribution plots: ***dot plot***, ***histogram***, ***density plot***, ***violin plot***

## Distribution Checklist {.smaller}

-   What is the **modality** of the distribution?

-   How many "peaks" are there?

-   Is the distribution **skewed** or **symmetric**?

-   Is there a longer "tail" on the left or right side?

-   Are there any **outliers**?

-   How extreme are the most extreme values?

-   What are the appropriate **summary statistics** for a distribution with this shape?

-   Would the mean+standard deviation or the median+IQR more accurately describe this data?

## Practice: Visualizing Distributions

```{r}
set.seed(123); dist_df <- data.frame(
  id = seq(1, 100),
  uniform = c(unlist(lapply(0:10, function(x) rep(x, 8))), 
              sample(0:10, 12, replace = T)), 
  left_skew = round(sapply(seq(1, 100), 
                     function(x) x^(1/3) * 2)),
  right_skew = round(sapply(seq(1, 100), 
                      function(x) x^2/1000)),
  normal = round(abs(rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 2))),
  bimodal = c(round(abs(rnorm(70, mean = 3, sd = 1))), 
              round(abs(rnorm(30, mean = 7, sd = 1)))),
  outlier = c(rpois(95, 3), sample(11:13, 5, replace = T))
)

dist_df |>
  pivot_longer(-id, names_to = 'distribution', 
               values_to = 'x') |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = 'steelblue', 
                 col = 'white',
                 binwidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ distribution, nrow = 2, 
    labeller = labeller(
      distribution = c('bimodal' = 'Plot A', 
                       'left_skew' = 'Plot B', 
                       'normal' = 'Plot C', 
                       'outlier' = 'Plot D', 
                       'right_skew' = 'Plot E', 
                       'uniform' = 'Plot F'))) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 15)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))
```

  pivot_longer(-id, names_to = 'distribution', 
               values_to = 'x') |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +

```

## Practice: Summary Statistics

Is the mean greater than, lesser than, or about equal to the mean? What does that mean for the shape of the distribution?

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(dist_df$bimodal) |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

## Practice: Summary Statistics

::: callout-tip
###### The mean is greater than the median indicating this is an asymmetrical distribution that is skewed. Because the mean is greater than the median, this distribution is right-skewed towards numbers on the high end of the range.
:::

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(dist_df$bimodal) |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

## Today

-   Analyze contingency (e.g. 2x2) tables

-   Summarizing categorical variables with proportions

-   Visualizing data using categories

-   Comparing data from 2+ variables

## What is a contingency table?

A ***contingency table*** is a cross-tabulation of the ***frequency*** of observations across 2 categorical variables

![In this table, the values are the count of observations that belong both the corresponding row and column categories.](class07/contingency-table-counts.png){fig-align="center"}

## What is frequency?

When someone describes a category's ***frequency***, they may be referring to...

-   ***Count***: the total number of times the category appears in the data

-   ***Proportion***: the total number of times the category appears in the data divided by the number of observations

## Calculating a proportion

Only a subset of observations belong to each level of a categorical variable. A proportion describes the count of the observations belonging to that category divided by the total number of observations ($n$).

$$
\operatorname{Proportion} = \frac{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{category})}{n}
$$

Proportions can be any real number between a minimum of 0 ($\frac{0}{n}$) and maximum of 1 ($\frac{n}{n}$).

## Calculating Proportions by row

![The row totals are all 1, which is the maximum value of a proportion. This indicates that the denominator for the proportions is the row total for each cell.](class07/contingency-table-row-proportions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Calculating Proportions by Column

![The column totals are all 1, which is the maximum value of a proportion. This indicates that the denominator for the proportions is the column total for each cell.](class07/contingency-table-col-proportions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example: Field Goals

In the NFL, kickers can play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of a game. Much time and money has been devoted to determining the factors which lead to a successful kick. Past performance is one factor which could affect whether a kick is good or not. Are kickers more or less likely to make the extra point kick if they missed their last kick?

```{r}
set.seed(123); kicks <- data.frame(
  kick_id = seq(1, 200), 
  last_kick = rbinom(200, 1, 0.64)
) |>
  mutate(this_kick = sapply(last_kick, function(x) {
    this_kick <- ifelse(x == 0, 
                        rbinom(1, 1, 0.4), 
                        rbinom(1, 1, 0.9))
  }))
```

## Contingency Table: Counts

```{r}
kicks |> 
  mutate(last_kick = ifelse(last_kick == 1, 'Made Last Kick', 
                            "Didn't Make Last Kick"), 
         this_kick = ifelse(this_kick == 1, 'Made Current Kick', 
                            "Didn't Make Current Kick")) |>
  tabyl(last_kick, this_kick) |>
  adorn_totals(where = c('row', 'col'))  |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

                            "Didn't Make Last Kick"), 
         this_kick = ifelse(this_kick == 1, 'Made Current Kick', 
                            "Didn't Make Current Kick")) |>
  tabyl(last_kick, this_kick) |>
  adorn_totals(where = c('row', 'col')) |>
  adorn_percentages(denominator = 'row') |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

## Contingency Table: Proportions by Column

```{r}
kicks |> 
  mutate(last_kick = ifelse(last_kick == 1, 'Made Last Kick', 
                            "Didn't Make Last Kick"), 
         this_kick = ifelse(this_kick == 1, 'Made Current Kick', 
                            "Didn't Make Current Kick")) |>
  tabyl(last_kick, this_kick) |>
  adorn_totals(where = c('row', 'col')) |>
  adorn_percentages(denominator = 'col') |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

## Visualizing Frequencies: Bar Plot (Counts)

```{r}
kicks |>
  pivot_longer(-kick_id, names_to = 'kick', values_to = 'status') |>
  mutate(status = ifelse(status == 1, 'Made Kick', "Didn't Make Kick"), 
         kick = ifelse(kick == 'last_kick', 'Last Kick', 'Current Kick')) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = kick)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(status))
```

```{r}
kicks |>
  pivot_longer(-kick_id, names_to = 'kick', values_to = 'status') |>

         kick = ifelse(kick == 'last_kick', 'Last Kick', 'Current Kick')) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = kick, y = after_stat(prop))) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'prop') +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(status))
```

## Comparing 2 Numerical Variables: Scatter plot

![](class07/scatter_plot_example.png){fig-align="center"}

## More ways to describe the relationship between 2 numerical variables

-   Is the relationship between the 2 variables ***linear*** or ***nonlinear ?***

-   Is the relationship ***strong*** or ***weak***?

## Example: describing numerical variable relationships

![](class07/scatter-plot-example-2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Visualizing the relationship between 2 numerical variables: add a regression line!

```{r}
#| fig-align: center


mtcars <- mtcars

mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 5, 
             color = 'steelblue') +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = 'lm')
```

## Does this line better "fit" the data?

```{r}
mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 5, 
             color = 'steelblue') +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = 'lm', se = F) +

## Homework 2

-   Describing numerical distributions: modality, skew, outliers

-   Describing numerical distributions: appropriate summary statistics

-   Matching numerical distributions to their summary statistics, reading a boxplot

-   Calculating proportions from a contingency table

## Homework 2 {.smaller}

-   Will be posted Friday 9/13/2024 after class

-   Will be due Friday 9/20/2024 by 6:00pm

-   I will post another instructional video for this homework, in addition to the one I did last time. If you're having trouble getting started, try watching both.

-   Late policy: "This homework is due by 6:00pm on Monday, 9/9/24. No credit will be lost for assignments received by 7:00pm to account for issues with uploading. 10% of the points will be deducted from assignments received by 9:00am on Tuesday, 9/10/24. Assignments turned in after this point are only eligible for 50% credit, so it benefits you to turn in whatever you have completed by the due date."

## How can I get help with homework? {.smaller}

-   ***Read the textbook.*** Many of you are asking for additional examples. Luckily, there are tons we didn't go over in the textbook.

-   ***Look at the homework early***. I can see in Canvas that many students didn't download the documents until 1-2 days before it was due. That's not a lot of time to get help.

-   ***Ask a question on our [Campuswire class feed](https://campuswire.com/c/G6427C531/feed).*** I'm only one person, and I may not be able to give you a prompt answer. However, the 28 other people in the class might be able to.

-   ***Come to office hours.*** I will be available after class Monday 9/23/2024 and Wednesday 9/25/2024 from 2:30pm - 4:00pm. If you cannot make it, reach out to me to try and schedule an appointment.
