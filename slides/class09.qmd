-   **Ask a question on our [Campuswire class feed](https://campuswire.com/c/G6427C531/feed).** I'm only one person, and I may not be able to give you a prompt answer. However, the 20+ other people in the class might be able to.

-   **Come to office hours.** I will be available after class today Wednesday 9/25/2024 from 2:30pm - 4:00pm. If you cannot make it, reach out to me to try and schedule an appointment.

## Chapter 3 Objectives

-   Define probability, random processes, and the law of large numbers

-   Describe the sample space for disjoint and non-disjoint outcomes

-   Calculate probabilities using the General Addition and Multiplication Rules

-   Create a probability distribution for disjoint outcomes

## Defining Probability

What does the word **probability** mean to you?

. . .

"Highly likely"

. . .

"Probably"

. . .

"About even"

. . .

"Almost no chance"

## People interpret probability differently

![Did your estimate fall within these ranges? Are these ranges reasonable?](https://github.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/blob/main/slides/class08/perceptions-of-probability.PNG?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## So what is probability?

::: callout-note
## Frequentist Definition

The proportion of times that a particular outcome would occur if we observed a random process an infinite number of times.
:::

-   A **random process** is one where you know which outcomes are possible (i.e. the **sample space**) but you don't know which outcome comes next

-   Examples of a **random process**: coin toss, die roll, stock market

## How do you know a process is random?

![Both Apple and Spotify took steps to make their "shuffle" features less random after complaints from users.](https://github.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/blob/main/slides/class08/shuffle.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## A brief history of "Shuffle"

-   January 11, 2005 – Apple releases the iPod Shuffle, a small device capable only of playing music randomly ("true" shuffle)

-   September 7, 2005 – Apple offers "Smart Shuffle" in response to complaints, which controlled how likely songs from the same album or artist would play close together

-   July 2011 – Spotify launches in the United States using the [Fisher-Yates Algorithm](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/), which is like picking tickets out of a hat until no more remain

-   February 2014 – Spotify modifies their sampling algorithm to ensure an even distribution across albums/artists

## What went wrong?

-   The human brain is good at finding patterns in noise, even when there are none

-   If an artist is repeated "too soon", the listener doesn't feel the order is random

-   We perceive a "random" distribution as also being "uniform" and "fair"

## So why didn't we like a "true" random shuffle?

-   Songs not evenly distributed across albums and artists on a playlist

-   Some albums/artists may play more frequently than others simply because they have more songs in the library/on the playlist

-   Each song is equally likely to play next, but not each artist

-   Artists/albums with more songs also more likely to play in a row

-   A true random shuffle might play the same artist multiple times in a row

-   It's unusual but not impossible to roll a 1 on a die 3 times in a row

-   It's also possible for the same song to play twice in a row

## Example: Spotify Playlists

```{r}
songs |> 
  mutate(artists = ifelse(artists %in% c('Taylor Swift', 
                                         'Chappell Roan', 
                                         'Billie Eilish', 
                                         'Adele', 
                                         'Lana Del Rey', 
                                         'Meghan Trainor') |
                            str_detect(artists, 'Charli'), 
                          artists, 'Other'),
         artists = str_replace_all(artists, 
                                   c(', ' = ',\n', 
                                     'Del Rey' = '\nDel Rey',
                                     'Chappell Roan' = 'Chappell\nRoan', 
                                     'Meghan Trainor' = 'Meghan\nTrainor'))) |>
  summarize(n = n(), .by = artists) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(artists, n), 
             y = n, fill = artists)) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill = 'none') +
  labs(title = "Number of Songs on the 'Taylor Swift Radio' playlist on Spotify by Artist(s)",
       subtitle = 'Total artists = 26', 
       x = 'Artist(s)', y = 'Count of Songs on Playlist')
```

## What if shuffle was truly random?

Each time the song changes, every song on the playlist is eligible to be played next

-   Does not matter if the song was just played

-   Does not matter who the artist is

We call this ***sampling with replacement***.

-   Like drawing a playing card, looking at it, then putting it back in the deck before the next draw

-   Repetition of outcomes is possible

## Sampling With Replacement

![](https://github.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/blob/main/slides/class09/Sampling With Replacement.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## How often were artists repeated during Spotify's original shuffle?

```{r}
set.seed(123)

repeat_df <- lapply(rep(10, 50), function(x) {
  artists_sampled <- unlist(songs[sample(1:nrow(songs), 
                                          x, replace = T), 
                                   'artists_split'])
  df <- data.frame(artists = unique(songs$artists)) |>
    mutate(n = sapply(artists, function(x) sum(artists_sampled == x)))
}) |>
  bind_rows(.id = 'sample') |>
  mutate(sample = lapply(sample, 
                         function(x) str_pad(x, width = 2, 
                                             side = 'left', pad = '0'))) |>
  mutate(artist = ifelse(artists %in% songs_summary$artists, 
                      artists, 'Other')) |>
  summarize(n = sum(n), 
            proportion = sum(n) / 10, 
            .by = c('sample', 'artist'))

repeat_df |>
  ggplot(aes(y = n, fill = artist)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, col = 'white') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  guides(fill = 'none') +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(artist)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, NA)) +
  labs(x = 'Count of Samples', y = 'Number of Times Played', 
       title = 'Number of Times Artist is Played in 10 Songs', 
       subtitle = 'n = 50')
```

## What is the probability of hearing a song by Chappell Roan?

-   There is our "observed" probability that the next song is by Chappell Roan

-   Sample proportion ($\hat{p}_n$)

-   There is some "true" real-world probability that the next song is by Chappell Roan

-   Population proportion ($p$)

## Defining the sample space

The **sample space** $s$ or $S$ is the total collection of possible outcomes for a **random process**.

-   Die rolls: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

-   Coin flips: heads, tails

-   Stock market: up, down, no change

Here, the **sample space** could be all the songs on the playlist (n = 50) or all the artists who perform them (n = 26).

## Defining the Sample Space

## Another sample space

![](https://github.com/sarah-grabinski/data1220-55_fall2024/blob/main/slides/class09/card_ss.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Disjoint Outcomes

Outcomes are **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** if they cannot both happen at the same time

-   Taylor Swift and Adele did not collaborate on any songs on this playlist

-   The next song played cannot be by both Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan

-   These are 

## Non-Disjoint Outcomes

**Non-disjoint** outcomes can occur at the same time.

-   The next song played could be by Charlie xcx OR Billie Eilish, because they collaborated on a song

## Calculating probabilities

-   Probabilities are proportions, or the number of observations with a particular value divided by...

-   the total number of observations in a sample ($n$)

-   the total number of outcomes in the sample space ($s$)

-   Proportions range from 0 (no observations in data) to 1 (all observations in data)

-   Also may be a percentage, ranging from 0% to 100% (multiply proportion by 100)

## Proportion of Songs by Artist

## How well does a sample proportion represent the population proportion?

Should we listen to 1 song?

```{r}
set.seed(123)

n_samples <- 1

## Law of Large Numbers

As more observations are collected, the sample proportion $\hat{p}_n$ of a particular outcome approaches the population proportion $p$ of that outcome.
