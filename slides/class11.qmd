## The General Addition Rule

The probability of event A ***or*** event B occurring is the sum of the probability that A occurs and the probability that B occurs minus the probability that A *and* B occurs.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{or} B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \operatorname{and} B) \\
&= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B) \\
&= P(A \cap B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example: The General Addition Rule for Non-Disjoint Events

-   The LA Dodgers have played 156 games so far in the 2024 season.

-   Shohei Hotani has hit 53 home runs and stolen 55 bases so far in the 2024 season. He did both in one game 34 times.

-   What's the probability that Shohei Hotani hits a home run *or* steals a base during the next Dodgers game?

## What's the probability that Shohei Otani hits a home run during the next game? {.smaller}

Shohei Hotani hits a home run approximately 1 out of every 3 games.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\operatorname{hits a home run})&=\frac{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{home runs})}{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{total games})} \\
&= \frac{53}{156} \\
&= 0.340
\end{aligned}
$$

## What's the probability that Shohei Otani steals a base during the next game? {.smaller}

Shohei Hotani steals a base approximately 1 out of every 3 games.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\operatorname{steals a base})&=\frac{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{stolen bases})}{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{total games})} \\
&= \frac{55}{156} \\
&= 0.353
\end{aligned}
$$

## What's the probability that Shohei Otani hits a home run *and* steals a base during the next game? {.smaller}

Shohei Hotani hits a home run *and* steals a base approximately 1 out of every 4-5 games.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run and} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix} &=\frac{\operatorname{count}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run and} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix}
  }{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{total games})} \\
&= \frac{34}{156} \\
&= 0.218
\end{aligned}
$$

## Putting it all together

Shohei Hotani hits a home run or steals a base approximately 1 out of every 2 games.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run or} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix} &= P(\operatorname{home run}) + P(\operatorname{stolen base}) \\
&\phantom{{}=1} - P\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run and} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix}
   \\
&= \frac{53}{156} + \frac{55}{156} - \frac{34}{156} \\
&= 0.474
\end{aligned}
$$

## The Odds

-   The ***odds*** of an event occurring is the probability of an event occurring divided by the probability of the event not occurring (i.e. its complement).

-   The odds are *for* or *in favor* of event A if $P(A) > P(A')$ ($P(A) > 0.5$) and $\operatorname{odds} > 1$

-   The odds *disfavor* or are *against* event A if $P(A) < P(A')$ ($P(A) < 0.5$) and $\operatorname{odds} < 1$.

## Describing the odds of an event {.smaller}

-   The odds of event A are expressed as a simplified ratio in terms of positive integers $a$ and $a'$ where $a$ is the approximate number of times that event A occurs for every time $a'$ that event A does not occur.

    *   $a:a'$ in favor of event A, when $P(A) > P(A') and $a > a'$
    
    *   $a':a$ against event A, when $P(A) < P(A') and $a' > a$

-   Example: if $P(A)=0.9$ and $\operatorname{odds}(A)=9$, then you would say, "The odds are 9:1 in favor of event A."

-   Example: if $P(A)=0.1$ and $\operatorname{odds}(A)=0.111$, then you would say, "The odds are 9:1 against event A."


## Example: The Odds {.smaller}

If the probability that Shohei Otani hits a home run or steals a base in the next game is 0.474, then the odds against Shohei Otani hitting a home run or stealing a base are ~11:10 (i.e. about even).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{odds}\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run or} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix} &= \frac{1-P \begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run or} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix}}{P \begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run or} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix}} \\
  &= \frac{1-0.474}{0.474} \\
  &= 1.11
\end{aligned}
$$

## The Addition Rule for Disjoint Events

When events A and B are ***disjoint***, the probability of event A ***or*** event B occurring is just the sum of the probability that A occurs and the probability that B occurs, because the probability that event A *and* event B occurs is 0.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{or} B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \operatorname{and} B) \\
&= P(A) + P(B) \\
&= P(A \cap B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example: The Addition Rule for Disjoint Events

-   Shohei Otani has had 611 at bats far in the 2024 season.

-   Shohei Hotani has hit 53 home runs and stolen 55 bases so far in the 2024 season.

-   What's the probability that Shohei Hotani hits a home run *or* steals a base during his next at bat?

## Describing the sample space

## Zooming in

![The probability that Shohei Otani hits a home run ***or*** steals a base during his next at bat.](class11/addition-sample-space-highlight.png){fig-align="center"}

## What's the probability that Shohei Otani hits a home run during his next at bat?  {.smaller}

Shohei Hotani hits a home run approximately 1 out of every 11 at bats.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\operatorname{hits a home run})&=\frac{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{home runs})}{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{at bats})} \\
&= \frac{53}{611} \\
&= 0.087
\end{aligned}
$$

## What's the probability that Shohei Otani steals a base during his next at bat? {.smaller}

Shohei Hotani steals a base approximately 1 out of every 11 at bats.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\operatorname{steals a base})&=\frac{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{stolen bases})}{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{at bats})} \\
&= \frac{55}{611} \\
&= 0.090
\end{aligned}
$$

## Putting it all together

Shohei Hotani hits a home run or steals a base approximately 1 out of every 5 at bats.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run or} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix} &= P(\operatorname{home run}) + P(\operatorname{stolen base}) \\
&= \frac{53}{611} + \frac{55}{611} \\
&= 0.177
\end{aligned}
$$

## Dependent Processes

-   If random process B is ***dependent*** on random process A, then the probability of random process B varies based on the outcome of random process A

-   *i.e. knowing the outcome of A provides additional information about the probability of B*

-   Example: When listening to a playlist using a "modern shuffle", the probability that the next song will be by a particular artist *does* change based on whether or not the last song played was also by that artist.

## The General Multiplication Rule

The probability of event A ***and*** event B occurring is the product of the probability that A occurs and the *conditional probability* that B occurs given that A has already occurred.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{and} B) &= P(A) \times P(B \operatorname{given} A) \\
&= P(A) \times P(B | A) \\
&= P(A \cup B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Independent Processes

-   If random process B is ***independent*** of random process A, then the probability of random process B does NOT vary based on the outcome of random process A 

-   *i.e. knowing the outcome of A does NOT provide additional information about the probability of B*

-   Example: When listening to a playlist using a "true shuffle", the probability that the next song will be by a particular artist *does not* change based on whether or not the last song played was also by that artist.

## Multiplication Rule for Independent Processes

The probability of event A ***and*** event B occurring is the product of the probability that A occurs and the probability that B occurs, because the probability of B does not change based on the outcome of A.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(A \operatorname{and} B) &= P(A) \times P(B \operatorname{given} A) \\
&= P(A) \times P(B | A) \\
&= P(A) \times P(B) \\
&= P(A \cup B)
\end{aligned}
$$

## How do you know if two random processes are independent? {.smaller}

-   Compare the conditional probabilities of B given the different possible outcomes of A. If $P(B|A)\approx P(B)$ for all values of A, then the two random processes are likely independent.

-   Calculate the probability that event A and B occur under both an independence model ($P(A \operatorname{and} B)=P(A)\times P(B)$) and a dependence model ($P(A \operatorname{and} B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$. 
    *   If $P(A)\times P(B) \approx P(A) \times P(B|A)$, then A and B are likely ***independent processes***.
    *   If $P(A)\times P(B) \neq P(A) \times P(B|A)$, then A and B are likely ***dependent*** processes.

## Example 1: Checking for Independence 

-   The LA Dodgers have played 156 games so far in the 2024 season.

-   Shohei Hotani has hit 53 home runs and stolen 55 bases so far in the 2024 season. In the 49 games in which he has hit a home run, he has stolen 18 bases.

-   Is the random process of Shohei Hotani hitting a home run ***independent*** of the random process of Shohei Hotani stealing a base?

&= \frac{53}{156} \\
&= 0.340
\end{aligned}
$$

## What's the conditional probability that Shohei Otani steals a base *given* that he has hit a home run during the game? {.smaller}

Shohei Hotani steals a base approximately 1 out of every 3-4 games in which he hits a one home run.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{stolen base} \\
    \operatorname{given home run}
  \end{pmatrix} &=\frac{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{stolen bases})}{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{home run games})} \\
&= \frac{18}{49} \\
&= 0.286
\end{aligned}
$$

## Putting it all together

Shohei Otani hits a home run ***and*** steals a base approximately 1 out of every 8 games.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{home run and} \\
    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix} &= P(\operatorname{home run}) \\ &\phantom{{}=1} \times P(\operatorname{stolen base} | \operatorname{home run}) \\
&= \frac{53}{156} \times \frac{18}{49} \\
&= 0.125
\end{aligned}
$$

## What's the probability that Shohei Otani steals a base given he does *NOT* hit a home run during the next game? {.smaller}

Shohei Hotani steals a base approximately 1 out of every 3 games in which he does *NOT* hit a home run.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\begin{pmatrix}
    \operatorname{stolen base given} \\
    \operatorname{no home run}
  \end{pmatrix} &=\frac{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{stolen bases})}{\operatorname{count}(\operatorname{no home run games})} \\
&= \frac{55-18}{156-49} \\
&= 0.346
\end{aligned}
$$

-   The conditional probability $P(\operatorname{stolen base} | \operatorname{home run})$ that Shohei Otani steals a base during the next Dodgers game given that he has scored a home run is 0.286.

-   The conditional probability $P(\operatorname{stolen base} | \operatorname{no home run})$ that Shohei Otani steals a base during the next Dodgers game given that he has not scored a home run is 0.346.

*Is the probability that Shohei Otani steals a base during a game meaningfully different based on whether or not he has hit a home run?*

## Calculating joint probability under a model of independence {.smaller}

    \operatorname{stolen base}
  \end{pmatrix} &= P(\operatorname{home run}) \times P(\operatorname{stolen base}) \\
