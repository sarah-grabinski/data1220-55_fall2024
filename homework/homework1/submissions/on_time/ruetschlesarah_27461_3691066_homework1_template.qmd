# Problem 2

## Question 1

Data Set 1: People from England and Wales above the age of 16, not living in communal homes.

Data Set 2: Records of investigated crimes, compiled with police discretion.

## Question 2

Data Set 1: The sampling strategy seems to be stratified random sampling as the population is divided into groups (over/under 16 and living in/not living in a communal home) and then a second sampling method of random sampling is employed within the over 16 and not living in a communal home strata.

Data Set 2: The sampling strategy seems to be simply random sampling from the database as each group in the database population has an equal chance of being included in the final sample and knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included.

## Question 3

Data Set 1: The 38,000 people who participated in the Crime Survey for England and Wales.

Data Set 2: All crimes investigated as recorded by the police at their discretion.

## Question 4

The target population is anyone living in England and Wales, specifically who may have experienced crime.

## Question 5

Data Set 1 is complied of self-reported experiences so it's reliability may be questioned as only those who wanted to respond did and their responses come from the memory of their experiences. Data Set 2 is more reliable as the information was recorded closer to the time of incident, but was recorded at the discretion of the police officers involved. Both data sets would seem valid, Data Set 1 for people's experiences of crimes and Data Set 2 for reported crimes, but both miss incidents of unreported crimes to the survey or to the police. The conclusions drawn from Data Set 1 can be somewhat generalized to the broader population with the knowledge that it excludes those under 16 and those living in communal homes, as well as those who chose not to respond to the survey. The conclusions drawn from Data Set 2 might be less able to be generalized as they are based only on reported crimes and the information that the police officers deemed relevant.

# Problem 3

## Question 1

The `<-` notation is equivalent to an `=` sign in R and is often used to declare variables. After running this code chunk, the named dataframe `df` appears in the environment on the right-hand side of RStudio.

```{r, read_csv}
# Note: Had to check box for package readr to use read_csv
df <- read_csv('https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/babies.csv')
```

## Question 2

The notation `Hmisc::` directly calls this function from the `Hmisc` package. `describe()` is a common function name, and sometimes this is needed to indicate to R which function from which package you want to use. The pipe feature `|>` sends the results of the first line directly into the function on the 2nd line and is a convenient way to chain functions together.

This code prints a useful and attractive summary of the data set we are using.

```{r, describe_data}
# Note: Had to check box for package Hmisc
Hmisc::describe(df) |> 
  html()
```

## Question 3

The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of topics. One study, in particular, considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. The variables in this data set are as follows.

| Variable Name | Variable Description                                         | Variable Type        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `case`        | id number                                                    | nominal categorical  |
| `bwt`         | birthweight, in ounces                                       | continuous numerical |
| `gestation`   | length of gestation, in days                                 | discrete numerical   |
| `parity`      | binary indicator for a first pregnancy (0 = first pregnancy) | nominal categorical  |
| `age`         | mother's age in years                                        | continuous numerical |
| `height`      | mother's height in inches                                    | continuous numerical |
| `weight`      | mother's weight in pounds                                    | continuous numerical |
| `smoke`       | binary indicator for whether the mother smokes               | nominal categorical  |

## Question 4

Below, 2 numeric variables were investigated for potential relationships. The independent, explanatory variable I chose is `gestation`, and the dependent, response variable I chose is `bwt`.

```{r plot_data}
# Note had to check box for package ggplot2
df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = gestation, # please change these
              y = bwt)) + 
  geom_point(color='darkblue', shape=8) + 
  ggtitle("Plot of Birth Weight by Gestation Length") +
  xlab("Gestation (days)") +
  ylab("Birth Weight (oz")
```

Overall, the data tends to have an increasing trend as length of gestation increases, so does the birth weight.
