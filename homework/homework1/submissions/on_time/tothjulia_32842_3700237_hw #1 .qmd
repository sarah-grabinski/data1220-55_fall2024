# Problem 2

## Question 1

The study population of data set 1 is 16 years of age or older, living in private households or not living in communal residence. The study population of data set 2 is records of crimes that have been investigated by UK police forces.

## Question 2

For data set 1 the strategy is voluntary reponse, the answers are self reported. The strategy for data set 2 is conveinece.

## Question 3

For data set 1 the sampled population is 38,000 people who were sampled. For data set 2 the sampled population is the records.

## Question 4

The target population for the data sets is 1 is UK residence.

## Question 5

The reliability for data set 1 is somewhat reliable because it's self reported and people could have lied, the reliability for data set 2 is reliable because it is records. The validity of data set 1 is good because it is a large number of people and a large age range. The validity of data set 2 is good because it is records. For the first data the study population is generalizable to the target population because it has a large age range and amount of people. Data set 2 is also generalizable to the target population because it is records.

# Problem 3

## Question 1

The `<-` notation is equivalent to an `=` sign in R and is often used to declare variables. After running this code chunk, the named dataframe `df` appears in the environment on the right-hand side of RStudio.

```{r, read_csv}
df <- read_csv('https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/babies.csv')
```

## Question 2

The notation `Hmisc::` directly calls this function from the `Hmisc` package. `describe()` is a common function name, and sometimes this is needed to indicate to R which function from which package you want to use. The pipe feature `|>` sends the results of the first line directly into the function on the 2nd line and is a convenient way to chain functions together.

This code prints a useful and attractive summary of the data set we are using.

```{r, describe_data}
Hmisc::describe(df) |> 
  html()
```

## Question 3

The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of topics. One study, in particular, considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. The variables in this data set are as follows.

| Variable Name | Variable Description                                         | Variable Type                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| `case`        | id number                                                    | Categorical, multicategorical |
| `bwt`         | birthweight, in ounces                                       | Numerical, continuous         |
| `gestation`   | length of gestation, in days                                 | Numerical, continuous         |
| `parity`      | binary indicator for a first pregnancy (0 = first pregnancy) | Categorical, binary           |
| `age`         | mother's age in years                                        | Numerical, continuous         |
| `height`      | mother's height in inches                                    | Numerical, continuous         |
| `weight`      | mother's weight in pounds                                    | Numerical, continuous         |
| `smoke`       | binary indicator for whether the mother smokes               | Categorical, binary           |

## Question 4

Below, 2 numeric variables were investigated for potential relationships. The independent, explanatory variable I chose is `variable_name`, and the dependent, response variable I chose is `variable_name`.

```{r plot_data}
df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = gestation, # please change these
             y = bwt)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Describe what you see in your plot here.

Between the gestation period of 250 to 300 is the highest birth weight is 100 to 150

# Session Info

This portion of the document describes the conditions in RStudio under which this report was created. This is important to include so that work is reproducible by others.
