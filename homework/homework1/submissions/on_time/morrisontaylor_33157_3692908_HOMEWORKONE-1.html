## Meet the penguins

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/main/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/lter_penguins.png){style="float:right;" fig-alt="Illustration of three species of Palmer Archipelago penguins: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie. Artwork by @allison_horst." width="401"}

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `{r} nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +

Problem 2

Questions

1.  The study population of data set 1 is 38,000 people. The study population of data set 2 is all police.

2.  The sampling strategy of data set 1 is to find 38,000 people that are 16 or older, and live in non-communal residences. The sampling strategy of data set 2 is to contact UK police about their internal definitions of crime

3.  the sampled population for data set 1 is people 16 or older living in non-communal residences. The sampled population for data set 2 is only UK police.

4.  The target population of the study is UK natives that have experiences with crime.

5.  The reliability of each data set is pretty low because all information in both data sets is self-reported and can be altered to appear a certain way. There is no scientific data as the responses are internally biased. As far as the validity for each date set, I feel that it is valid in terms of finding opinions of those in the areas they're testing. But, certain responses could change the outcome of the study with no scientific reasoning. I think that the conclusions from the study population are not generalizable to the entire population as they chose samples of people to test and they all share traits in common, this could not be in reference to the entire population.

    Problem 3

    Question 1

    ```{r}
    ("tidyverse/ggplot2")
    ```

    ```{r}
    ("ggplot2"")
    ```

    ```{r}
    df <- read_csv('https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/babies.csv')
    ```

    `{Hmisc::describe(df) |>}   html()`

    Question 2

    ```{r}
    Hmisc::describe(df) |> 
      html()
    ```

Question 3

(in global environment)

Question 4

/

```{r}
df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age,
              y = smoke)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
df |> ggplot(aes(x = case, # y = age)) + geom_point()


```

```{r}

```

In the plot, I see that there is no relationship between age and , the variables are independent.
