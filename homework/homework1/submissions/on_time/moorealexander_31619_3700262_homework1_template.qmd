# Problem 2

## Question 1

In data set 1 the study population are residence of England and Wales over the age of 16. In data set 2 the population is all of the people in the UK.

## Question 2

The sampling strategy in data set 1 is a survey where approximately 38,000 people were surveyed and the answers are self-reported. Data set 2 the data is collected from the UK Police administrative records.

## Question 3

The sampled population in data set 1 is 38,000 people who reside in England and Wales. In data set 2 the sampled population is anyone who has been charged with committing a crime in the UK.

## Question 4

The target population is all people in the UK.

## Question 5

Ultimately, the reliability of each data set varies. In the first data set I would say that it is not a completely reliable data source because the areas that were surveyed do not make up all of the UK. Also, the 38,000 that were surveyed do not make up the entire population in those areas. Additionally, the survey excluded any person under the age of 16 and if they were living in communal residences where an excess of crimes could be committed. In data set 2 I would say that this is a reliable source for this data. This is due to the fact that it is coming directly from the police administrative records. Regarding the validity of the two data sets, I would say that they are both valid. The data that is represented in the police administrative records I find hard to believe that it is fake, and the first data set, no one knows what is happening in a community better than those living in it. However, there could be some invalid data present. Regarding the generality of the data, I would say that data set 1 is not generalized because it focuses on specific areas, and those areas are different than the rest of the UK. Whereas data set 2 would be because it is an accurate representation of the crimes that are committed.

# Problem 3

## Question 1

The `<-` notation is equivalent to an `=` sign in R and is often used to declare variables. After running this code chunk, the named dataframe `df` appears in the environment on the right-hand side of RStudio.

```{r, read_csv}
df <- read_csv('https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/babies.csv')
```

## Question 2

The notation `Hmisc::` directly calls this function from the `Hmisc` package. `describe()` is a common function name, and sometimes this is needed to indicate to R which function from which package you want to use. The pipe feature `|>` sends the results of the first line directly into the function on the 2nd line and is a convenient way to chain functions together.

This code prints a useful and attractive summary of the data set we are using.

```{r, describe_data}
Hmisc::describe(df) |> 
  html()
```

## Question 3

The Child Health and Development Studies investigate a range of topics. One study, in particular, considered all pregnancies between 1960 and 1967 among women in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in the San Francisco East Bay area. The variables in this data set are as follows.

| Variable Name | Variable Description                                         | Variable Type          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| `case`        | id number                                                    | Nominal (Categorical)  |
| `bwt`         | birthweight, in ounces                                       | Continuous (Numerical) |
| `gestation`   | length of gestation, in days                                 | Continuous (Numerical) |
| `parity`      | binary indicator for a first pregnancy (0 = first pregnancy) | Nominal (Categorical)  |
| `age`         | mother's age in years                                        | Continuous (Numerical) |
| `height`      | mother's height in inches                                    | Continuous (Numerical) |
| `weight`      | mother's weight in pounds                                    | Continuous (Numerical) |
| `smoke`       | binary indicator for whether the mother smokes               | Nominal (Categorical)  |

## Question 4

Below, 2 numeric variables were investigated for potential relationships. The independent, explanatory variable I chose is `variable_name`, and the dependent, response variable I chose is `variable_name`.

```{r plot_data}
df |>
  # Set x and y variables with aes
  ggplot(aes(x = weight , 
              y = height)) + 
  # add a scatterplot
  geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = 'lm', col = 'red') 

```

As the weight increases, the height increases and most of the data falls within a close range to the regression line with the exception of a few outliers.
