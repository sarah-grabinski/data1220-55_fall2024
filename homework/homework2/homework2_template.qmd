## Loading the Data

I loaded the data into RStudio and selected the variables I would be analyzing.

```{r}
## Load the NHANES data set from the package
nhanes_df <- NHANES |>
  select(Weight, Height, Pulse,
         BPDiaAve, AgeMonths, DiabetesAge, 
         Gender, SleepTrouble)

head(nhanes_df)
```

# Numerical Summary

Before performing any analysis, I looked summary statistics for my variables.

```{r}

# Problem 4 - Calculating Proportions for Contingency Tables

I used the `tabyl()` function from the `janitor` package to create a 2 x 2 contingency table of counts from the variables `Gender` and `SleepTrouble` in my data set `nhanes_df`. I excluded subjects with missing data for either variable with the `filter()` function and `is.na()` function. I used the `adorn_totals()` function from the `janitor` package to add totals to both my rows `row` and columns `col`. I then used the functions `kbl()` and `kable_classic()` from the `kableExtra` package to make my table attractive to display.

```{r}
nhanes_df |>
  filter(!is.na(Gender), !(is.na(SleepTrouble))) |>
  janitor::tabyl(Gender, SleepTrouble) |>
  janitor::adorn_totals(where = c('row', 'col')) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = 'Self-Reported Trouble Sleeping by Gender in the NHANES study for years 2009-2012 (n = 7,772)') |>
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

In the tables below, I will calculate proportions for my contingency table by row and by column.

## Row Proportions

|            |        |         |           |
|------------|--------|---------|-----------|
|            | **No** | **Yes** | **Total** |
| **Female** |        |         |           |
| **Male**   |        |         |           |
| **Total**  |        |         |           |

: Proportions of those who do or do not have trouble sleeping by gender in NHANES subjects from the years 2009-2012 (n = 10,000)

## Column Proportions

|            |        |         |           |
|------------|--------|---------|-----------|
|            | **No** | **Yes** | **Total** |
| **Female** |        |         |           |
| **Male**   |        |         |           |
| **Total**  |        |         |           |

: Proportions of men and women by whether they have trouble sleeping or not in NHANES subjects from the years 2009-2012 (n = 10,000)
