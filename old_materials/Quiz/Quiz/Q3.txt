In a multiple choice exam, there are 5 questions and 4 choices for each question. A student has not studied for the exam at all and decides to randomly guess the answers.
What is the probability that:

(a) the student only gets the first question and the last question right?
(b) the student gets all of the questions wrong?
(c) the student gets at least one question wrong?

Answers:
(a) 0.25 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.0264
(b) (0.75)^5 = 0.2373
(c) 1 - (0.25)^5 = 0.999
