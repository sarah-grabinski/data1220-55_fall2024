In a multiple choice exam, there are 5 questions and 4 choices for each question. A student has not studied for the exam at all and decides to randomly guess the answers.
What is the probability that:

(a) the student only gets the first two questions right?
(b) the student gets the last question wrong?
(c) the student gets at least one question wrong?

Answers:
(a) 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.0264
(b) (0.25)^4 * 0.75 = 0.0029
(c) 1 - (0.25)^5 = 0.999
